# Common Requirements and Setup

These scripts expect to have write access to $HOME and /tmp.

These scripts will create directories at $HOME/dockerkeys and $HOME/dockershare.  If you want to use different directories then you'll need to modify the common/env-config.sh file AND all YAML files.

You will need to have an account on Docker Store.  You will need to register for the store/ibmcorp/isam image in the store.

All passwords set by these scripts are `Passw0rd`.  Obviously this is not a secure password!

# Create Keystores
Before running any other scripts, run `studentfiles/container-install/common/create-ldap-and-postgres-keys.sh`

This will create the $HOME/dockerkeys directory and populate it with keystores for PostgreSQL and OpenLDAP containers.

# Native Docker
To set up a native Docker environment, use the files in studentfiles/container-install/docker.

These scripts will create the $HOME/dockershare directory.

These scripts assume you have the following IP addresses available locally on your Docker system:
- 127.0.0.2 (isam.iamlab.ibm.com)
- 127.0.0.3 (www.iamlab.ibm.com)

If you want to use other local IP addresses then you'll need to modify the common/env-config.sh file.

First, use `docker login` to log in to Docker.

Then run `./docker-setup.sh` script to create docker containers.

You can now connect to the ISAM LMI at https://127.0.0.2

To clean up the docker resources created, run the `./cleanup.sh` script.

# Docker Compose
To set up an environment with docker-compose, use the files in studentfiles/container-install/compose.

These scripts will create the $HOME/dockershare directory.

These scripts assume you have the following IP addresses available locally on your Docker system:
- 127.0.0.2 (isam.iamlab.ibm.com)
- 127.0.0.3 (www.iamlab.ibm.com)

If you want to use other local IP addresses then you'll need to modify the common/env-config.sh file and run `./update-env-file.sh`

First, use `docker login` to log in to Docker.

Run `./create-keyshares.sh` to copy keys to $HOME/dockershare/composekeys directory

Change directory to the `iamlab` directory.

Run command `docker-compose up -d` to create containers.

You can now connect to the ISAM LMI at https://127.0.0.2

To clean up the docker resources created, run `docker-compose down -v` command.

# Kubernetes
To set up an environment using Kubernetes, use the files in studentfiles/container-install/kubernetes.

These scripts assume that you have the `kubectl` utility installed and that it is configured to talk to your cluster.

First, run `./create-docker-store-secret.sh` command and provide your Docker credentials.

Next, run `./create-secrets.sh` command to create the secrets required for the environment.

Finally, run `kubectl create -f <YAML file>` to define the resources required.

There are YAML files for the following environments:
- Minikube (sam-minikube.yaml)
   - Also works with Kubernetes included with Docker CE on Mac
- IBM Cloud (sam-ibmcloud.yaml)
- Google (sam-google.yaml)

Once all pods are running, you can run the `./lmi-access.sh` script to start a port-forward session for access to the LMI.
With this running, you can access LMI using at https://localhost:9443

To access the Reverse Proxy you will need to determine an External IP for a Node in the cluster and then connnect to this using https on port 30443.

For Google, access to a NodePort requires the following filewall rule to be created:
`gcloud compute firewall-rules create isamwrp-node-port --allow tcp:30443`

# OpenShift
This is a work in progress.  OpenShift is not supported by Access Manager at this time.

# Backup and Restore

To backup the state of your environment, use the `./sam-backup....sh` script in the directory for the environment you're using.  The backup tar file created will contain:
- Content of the $HOME/dockerkeys directory
- OpenLDAP directory content
- PostgreSQL database content
- Configuration snapshot from ISAM config container

To restore from a backup, perform these steps:

1. Delete the $HOME/dockerkeys and $HOME/dockershare directories
1. Run `studentfiles/container-install/common/restore-keys.sh <archive tar file>`
1. Complete setup for the environment you want to create (until containers are running)
1. Run `./sam-restore....sh <archive tar file>` to restore configuration.

Note that you will see errors during the restore when it attempts to create LDAP and DB objects that already exist.
